# LMU-Datathon-2024
Joanna Estrada, Sam Biner, Kevin Khirich, and Arnav Gumdala team up to cover EPA data for LMU's second annual Datathon, hosted by ISBA Society.

## Who are the stakeholders?
    Small Businesses, Women-owned small businesses, and minority-owned small businesses: 
    EPA and EPA Employees: EPA can be a major potential stakeholder since it is the only agency that is offering to award these certain contracts under different circumstances. The EPA may be extremely interested in the analysis to see how they can improve diversity in their contract awards.
## What is our problem:
    The EPA’s system of distributing rewards is flawed, and companies don’t have the proper knowledge to navigate this landscape

## How will we solve the problem:
    Use the EPA datasets given to analyze what actions companies can take to maximize awards granted
